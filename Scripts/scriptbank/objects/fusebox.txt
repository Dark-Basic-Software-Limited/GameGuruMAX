Fusebox Behavior

The Fusebox behaviour allows for a fuse to be placed in a fusebox to
switch/activate other objects or zones.

There are two seperate but related behaviours
1. The Fuse
Place the Fuse object where required and adjust the options in the behaviour.
PROMPT TEXT and RANGE to pick up
<Sound0> for pickup

2. The Fuse Box
This object will be treated as a switch object for activating other objects
or game elements. Set Always Active = On

Place the fuse box where required and adjust the options in the behaviour.
PROMPT TEXT and RANGE to use
<Sound0> for fuse insertion
<Sound1> for switched on eg (power up sound)

Link the fusebox with the logic connector to whatever you wish to activate.

The Fuseboxe cannot operate until the fuse is attached. If in posession of
a fuse and within range of the the fuse box then using the fuse box, the
fuse will be inserted and fuse box turned on and activate the linked object.
