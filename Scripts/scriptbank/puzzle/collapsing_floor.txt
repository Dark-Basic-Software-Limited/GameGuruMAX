Collapsing Floor Behaviour

Can be used on any floor tiles or section object.
Creates a collapsing Floor area oject when walked on. Physics=ON, Gravity=ON

Behavior options:

Set the PROMPT TEXT  eg: "Floor is collapsing"
Set the COLLAPSE TYPE to Collapsing or Fading
Set the ACTIVE TIME to collapse
Set the ACTIVE RANGE toe collapsing section/object
Set the fall DAMAGE TYPE to either Fixed Fall or Natural Fall 
Set the DAMAGE HEIGHT for commencement of fall damage
Set the COLLISION SCALE to adjust physics collision scale of object
for tight fitting object/sections
