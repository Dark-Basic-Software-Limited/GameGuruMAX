How To Run The Wizbang Workshop Updates Checker
===============================================

. Run the latest EXP build and click the Workshop Tab in the HUB
. Click the 'Update Workshop Items' button to instruct the software to refresh to the latest workshop items
. The above step actually involves the software unsubscribing and then auto-resubscribing, tricking Steam to get the latest
. You may need to exit MAX and relaunch in order for the latest workshop items to appear in the list
. Note that only the 'Extra Behaviors' workshop item is attended to for now
. Before starting the process of getting the latest updates, run GitHub Desktop so you can see the differences between the current and the new changes
. Once the workshop items change to the latest update dates in the list, run "1-CopyScriptsFromLiveWORKSHOP.bat", maybe found "C:\DEV\GAMEGURUMAXREPO"
. Now change in GitHub Desktop for all changes, additions and deletions to ensure they are all reasonable
. For changed files, look for the Vx number at the top changing from a low number to a higher one, this is correct
. Discard any changes that show a Vx number at the top changing from a high number to a lower number, this means we have improved this script locally
. When discarding, and the script is an improvement to share with the workshop item author, follow the instructions in "3-CopyLatestTestScriptsForSHARING.bat"
. In following the above instructions, you will be pasting in relative paths to the script in question to the "2-CopyLatestTestScriptsForSHARING.txt" text file for later
. Notice any files that have been included accidentally, and mark them to be ignored, maybe: "Scripts\scriptbank\objects\npc_flashlight.lua.bak"
. Finally, and most importantly for now, check changes to ensure parameters are ONLY added to the END of the _properties( function in the script!
. As an example of the above, it is WRONG to go from "gravity_zone_properties(e, gravity_level, fall_rate, zoneheight, SpawnAtStart)" to "gravity_zone_properties(e, gravity_level, fall_rate, auto_lift, zoneheight, trigger_type, trigger_height, SpawnAtStart)", and should be discarded!
. Another example to discard is "npc_event_properties(e, event_duration, idle_animation, event_animation, end_trigger, fade_speed)" to "npc_event_properties(e, event_trigger, range, event_duration, idle_animation, event_animation, end_trigger, fade_speed, instant_ragdoll)"
. Another example to discard is "vendor_properties(e, prompt_text, prompt_range, noise_range, vendor_animation, vendored_max_quantity, vendored_entity_cost, vendored_entity_lifespan, vendored_entity_name, vendored_entity_no, user_global_affected)" to "vendor_properties(e, prompt_text, prompt_range, noise_range, vendor_animation, vendored_max_quantity, vendored_entity_cost, vendored_entity_lifespan, vendored_entity_name, user_global_affected, when_empty)"
. Another example to discard is "clone_entity_properties(e, clone_quantity, clone_range, clone_lifespan, entity_name, entity_no, diagnostics, clone_health, respawn_cycle, respawn_events, respawn_interval)" to "clone_entity_properties(e, clone_quantity, clone_range, clone_lifespan, clone_health, respawn_cycle, respawn_events, respawn_interval, entity_name)"
. Once all these changes and ignored files have been made, the changes can be committed to change the contents of the "C:\DEV\GAMEGURUMAXREPO\Scripts" folder
. You can now use GitHub Desktop and click the PUSH ORIGIN button to upload the commit to the cloud under the latest build branch
. If you copied any relative paths to scripts that are newer on the local side, you can complete the instructions given in "3-CopyLatestTestScriptsForSHARING.bat"
. The above will help you to prepare a ZIP file that contains your newer local versions of scripts to send to the workshop item owner
. Beofre you copy these new scripts to the upload area, you can test them by copying them from "C:\DEV\GAMEGURUMAXREPO\Scripts" to "C:\DEV\BUILDS\GameGuru Wicked MAX Build Area\Max\Files" and use your build area to test a few of them
. Once you are happy with the tests, run "4-CopyGoodScriptsToBuildArea.bat" to copy the scripts to the upload area, maybe at: "D:\Dropbox\MAXMASTER\Steam Upload\Steamworks SDK\tools\ContentBuilder\content_max\Max\Files"
. Verify the scripts actually copied by opening one of the destination script files, maybe "D:\Dropbox\MAXMASTER\Steam Upload\Steamworks SDK\tools\ContentBuilder\content_max\Max\Files\scriptbank\effects\lightcontrol.lua"
. Open the LUA script file and check the Vx number, and compare agains the history tab of the latest commit in GitHub Desktop, they should match to the change made
. Open the "changelog.txt" file, maybe located at "C:\DEV\BUILDS\GameGuru Wicked MAX Build Area\Max"
. Add a line to the change log to describe the kind of updates that have been made to the scripts, perhaps how many. The format is "[change descripton][.][ ]" where the dot character ends the sentence followed by a SPACE character
. Ensure the line added is always placed in between the first line and the last line
. Copy the "changelog.txt" file to the upload area, maybe to: "D:\Dropbox\MAXMASTER\Steam Upload\Steamworks SDK\tools\ContentBuilder\content_max\Max"
. If the day of this change differs from the date shown in the "changelog.txt" file, also update the "version.ini" file to reflect todays date in the format used in the file
. If the "version.ini" has thus been changed, also copy that to the upload area, maybe at: "D:\Dropbox\MAXMASTER\Steam Upload\Steamworks SDK\tools\ContentBuilder\content_max\Max"
. Once all the above steps have been completed successfully, we can upload these files from the upload area to Steam
. Ensure Steam client is not running, and then run the batch file "UPDATE JUST MAX.bat", maybe located at: "D:\Dropbox\MAXMASTER\Steam Upload\Steamworks SDK\tools\ContentBuilder"
. They Steam console may request a Steam Guard code, if so, request it from "leebambertgc@gmail.com" and then use the code to continue the upload process
. Delete the Steam Guard Code email from "leebambertgc@gmail.com" when it has been used 
. When the upload is complete and the user has the command prompt again, type 'Exit' and hit ENTER to leave the command line window
. Now go to the Steamworks > SteamPipe tab for GameGuru MAX, maybe at: "https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/builds/1247290"
. Scroll down to see the 'GameGuru MAX Only' build line that has just been uploaded
. Click the 'Select an app branch' drop down on the right of this line and select 'experimental', then click the respective 'Preview Change' button to its right
. Scroll down and select the 'Set Build Live Now' and then click OK to confirm this action 
. Your latest script file changes are now part of the latest EXP build on Steam
